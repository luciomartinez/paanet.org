Paanet's brand new website

## Status

The organization has shutdown due economical reasons.

## Code

There was two branches separating an 

### v1

Initial idea contemplated the next pages:
 - Homepage describing who Paanet is
 - News section
 - Admin panel to keep news updated
 - Contact form
 - Donations (never built/published)
 
It wasn't perfect so here's a list of issues:
 - The admin panel has never been used.
 - Contact form was constantly breaking since it required a manual email setting to be set now and then.
 - Dontains was never setup

With this issues, it turned into a website to get basic info and contact details.
Here's where the next version made sense.

### v2

Instead of such a strong website built on v1, this new version was a single page showing ORG's info and contact details.
Purely built on HTML+CSS it was easier to publish and maintain.
The only cool feature I can think of is its Dark theme (done via CSS).
